# Online-Examination-System-User-Management-Templates-and-Validation
In this review, you are submit HTML templates for user management, styled using CSS and Bootstrap, along with JavaScript implementations for form validation and interactivity.

Code Execution Steps:-

This code creates a simple user management form for an online examination system. Here's a breakdown:

HTML Structure
HTML Document Setup:

The document begins with a standard HTML structure including a <head> section for metadata and linking CSS files, and a <body> section for content.
The page title is "Online Examination - User Management".
CSS Styling:

Bootstrap is used for general styles and responsiveness.
A custom CSS file, styles.css, is linked for additional styling.
Form Design:

The main content is a form for managing user data, enclosed in a div with a class form-container.
The form includes fields for:
Username: A text input field.
Email: A field that accepts email addresses.
Password: A password input field.
Role: A dropdown menu to select user roles (Admin, Student, Instructor).
Each field has validation messages (e.g., "Please enter a username") displayed when validation fails.
A "Submit" button is styled using Bootstrap classes.
JavaScript Functionality
Event Listener:

When the page loads, JavaScript adds a submit event listener to the form.
Form Validation:

When the form is submitted, JavaScript checks its validity:
If any field is invalid, the form stops processing, displays error messages, and highlights invalid fields.
If the form is valid:
Data from the form fields is collected into a FormData object.
The form data is converted to a JavaScript object and logged to the console.
A success message ("User data submitted successfully!") is displayed to the user.
The form is reset, and validation highlights are cleared.

Key Features

Bootstrap Integration: Ensures a responsive and visually appealing layout.
Client-Side Validation: Provides immediate feedback to users without submitting the form to the server.
Form Reset: Clears the form after successful submission.

This design is simple and suitable for tasks like adding or updating user data in a system.
